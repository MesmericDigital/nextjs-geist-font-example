## Implementation Plan for WordPress Plugin "bbp-core"

### Overview
The "bbp-core" plugin will be developed to work with the Roots Sage theme and WooCommerce, providing additional functionality for the Breakdance Builder. The plugin will be structured using Roots Acorn, which allows for a modern development approach in WordPress.

### Dependencies
- **PHP 8.4**: Ensure the server environment supports PHP 8.4.
- **Roots Acorn**: The plugin will utilize the Roots Acorn framework for structure and functionality.
- **WooCommerce**: The plugin will integrate with WooCommerce for e-commerce functionalities.
- **Breakdance Builder**: The plugin will provide add-ons for the Breakdance Builder.

### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Setup Plugin Structure**
   - Create a new directory for the plugin: `wp-content/plugins/bbp-core`.
   - Inside this directory, create the following files:
     - `bbp-core.php`: Main plugin file.
     - `composer.json`: For managing dependencies.
     - `config/`: Directory for configuration files.
     - `src/`: Directory for source code.

2. **Main Plugin File (`bbp-core.php`)**
   - Add the plugin header information:
     ```php
     <?php
     /**
      * Plugin Name: bbp-core
      * Description: A plugin to enhance WooCommerce with Breakdance Builder add-ons.
      * Version: 1.0.0
      * Author: Your Name
      * License: GPL2
      */
     ```
   - Include the autoload file from Composer:
     ```php
     require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
     ```

3. **Composer Setup**
   - Create a `composer.json` file to manage dependencies:
     ```json
     {
       "require": {
         "roots/acorn": "^2.0",
         "woocommerce/woocommerce": "^8.0"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Run `composer install` to install dependencies.

4. **Configuration Files**
   - Create a configuration file in the `config/` directory to manage settings and options for the plugin.

5. **Integrate with WooCommerce**
   - In the `src/` directory, create a file `woocommerce-integration.php` to handle WooCommerce-related functionalities.
   - Use hooks to add custom functionalities, such as:
     - Adding custom product types.
     - Modifying checkout fields.
     - Adding custom settings in the WooCommerce settings page.

6. **Breakdance Builder Add-ons**
   - Create a file `breakdance-addons.php` in the `src/` directory.
   - Define custom elements or functionalities that can be used within the Breakdance Builder.

7. **Error Handling and Best Practices**
   - Implement error handling for all functionalities, ensuring that any issues are logged and displayed appropriately.
   - Follow WordPress coding standards for all PHP code.
   - Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized and validated.

8. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for the plugin functionalities using PHPUnit.
   - Ensure that the plugin is tested with the latest version of WordPress and WooCommerce.

9. **Documentation**
   - Create a `README.md` file to document the plugin's features, installation instructions, and usage.

### UI/UX Considerations
- The plugin will not have a dedicated UI but will enhance existing WooCommerce and Breakdance Builder interfaces.
- Ensure that any new elements added to the Breakdance Builder are visually consistent with the existing design.

### Summary
- Create the "bbp-core" plugin with a modern structure using Roots Acorn.
- Integrate with WooCommerce and provide Breakdance Builder add-ons.
- Implement error handling and follow best practices for WordPress development.
